# ontlogin sample container

## what is
  This repository has been built to make it easy for anyone to try out ONTLOGIN.  
  If you have a Docker environment, you can try out the simplest implementation of QR code authentication in a few steps.  

## Required
  * docker(recommend version 20.10.11~)
  * docker-compose(recommend version 1.25.0~)
  * internet connection
  * linux console(I used ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS on wsl)

## how to run

  first time, please run build.sh
```bash
build.sh
```
  What we are doing in build.sh is as follows.  
  at the 1st, build backend script.  
  2nd, build frontend script.  
  use golang (1.17) container and node lts container(now version is 16).  

```bash
docker run --rm -w /go/src/app -v $PWD/backend:/go/src/app golang:1.17 bash -c "go build"
docker run --rm -w /opt/app -v $PWD/frontend:/opt/app node:lts-stretch bash -c "npm install ; npm run build"
```
  next step, run docker-compose.  

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

  With the default settings, you can try ONT ID login using QR code by visiting http://localhost:8080.
